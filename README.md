# Game Project

Welcome to my game project! My name is William, I'm currently a student at HTB Academy, learning Bash scripting
and IT concepts. This project is part of my learning journey, and I plan to continually enhance it as I 
grow in my skills. Since I'm new to this, any feedback, suggestions, or contributions are welcomed 
and greatly appreciated.

This is a simple Bash-based game where players select a character and battle a beast and a dragon.
More features will be added as I learn more about Bash scripting and IT development!
